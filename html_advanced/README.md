# HTML Advanced Project

Welcome to the HTML_advanced project in the `atlas_web_development` repo for Atlas School! In this project, I'll be exploring advanced HTML topics using a Figma file and wireframe as my guide.

## Project Overview

This project will contain only html. No in-line styling or css files will be added. This project is for learning how to build a basic html page from a wireframe. Navigation bar, banner, quote block, video list, membership section, FAQ, and a footer will be added.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DAlsabrook/atlas-web-development.git
