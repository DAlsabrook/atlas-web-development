# CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to the CSS_advanced project in the `atlas_web_development` repo for Atlas School! In this project, I'll be diving into advanced CSS topics, using a Figma file as my guide to recreate a detailed and styled webpage.

## Project Overview

This project will focus exclusively on CSS. The objective is to replicate the design provided in the Figma file, paying close attention to image sizes, font sizes, font weights, spacing, and colors. By the end of this project, I will have a fully styled webpage hosted on GitHub Pages.
